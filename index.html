    <p>Some nights I lie in bed in a cold sweat thinking about plastic waste. When I see a plastic bottle in a trash can and not a recycling bin, I feel like I’ve lost a year off my life, so I’m basically living on borrowed time. 
</p>
     </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
    <p>Even though I love the earth and want to protect her from the plague of plastic, throughout this past year, I pretty much ate every meal out of a to-go container from the New School’s cafeteria. 
</p>
     </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
    <p>The New School has a strong commitment to being environmentally conscious, or sustainability. Even though the school has this commitment to sustainability, I still feel like the only person at the school who actually cares about waste diversion.

  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
    <p>“Sustainability is a pretty broad and often misused and thrown around by PR people.” said Erik Eibert, Assistant Director of Sustainability Initiatives at the The New School.  “It’s our actions aligned with how we look at the long term.”
</p>
     </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
     <p>The New School focuses on many different aspects of sustainability, including 
emissions, waste, water, and energy, according to the University’s Sustainability Dashboard on the school’s website. Among these different sustainability practices of the New School, waste reduction is a key pillar in the University’s efforts. 
</p>
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
     <p>
“There are many different players at work. Providing recapticles, bagging up the waste and putting it outside, and students and faculty putting waste in the correct bins.” said Eibert.

     <p>
Having correct and sustainable waste receptacles at the New School is a key aspect in the university’s efforts. The New School recently revamped the colors and graphics on the signs on or near different waste bins so trash could be separated more effectively, according to Eibert. 
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
     <p>
Even though the design for the bins has been made so it is easier for people to dispose of their trash correctly, waste is usually not diverted correctly  
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
     <p>
“The most important thing is to be cognizant of where you’re placing your waste,” Eibert said, “Throwing it in the right bin is casual but critical.”
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
     <p>
Eibert also said that because of human error, not recycling some waste, 70% of trash that heads to the landfill could have been recycled. 
</p>
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
     <p>
Annually, The New School provides data regarding waste management along with other sustainability practices. The New School currently has a waste diversion rate of 47%, which is a percentage that shows what waste was prevented from going to landfills, according to data provided by The New School.

     <p>The New School sustainability site, where waste diversion data and other environmental efforts are posted, is uncommon for universities, said Eibert.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col m8 offset-m2">
     <p>While the New School is on a much smaller scale than community districts in New York, Community District 01, which comprises the Financial District in Manhattan, has a diversion rate of 26.9%, according to the Department of Sanitation. This rate is the highest diversion rate in all five boroughs of New York City.

				<p> The New School promotes sustainability through hosting events where waste is properly sorted, publishing reports on efforts, and directly teaching sustainability to students. The University’s sustainability promotion hasn’t been well received by students, however.  </p>

        <p> “Sure [The New School does] a better job than other universities when it comes to being sustainable, but offering a class that everyone hates doesn’t do anything. I feel like [Sustainable Systems] was created to prove that the school is as sustainable as they say we are,” said Erynn Quirk, a First-Year Parson student. </p>

        <p> Sustainable Systems, a requirement for Parsons First-Year students, aims to teach parson students how to be a sustainable designers in changing conditions of creative works. The course’s objective is to “frame students' observations as they study real conditions that are both local and accessible and in­ class discussions teach students to translate research into creative solutions,” according to the class’ listing in the course catalogue.  </p>
<br> <br>
 <p> “None of our assignments are graded so it feels like the class is worthless. If they’re going to make me take this type of class, have it offer solutions and not busy work. It’s not helping anybody. I want a class that actually teaches about sustainable design.” said Quirk.</p>

 <br> <br>
 <p>Sustainable Systems isn’t the only promotional tactic by the University. Erik Eibert highlighted the recycling program of school materials for incoming students at the end of each school year as one of the ways the sustainable waste management is encouraged to students. </p>

        <p>While Sustainable Systems hasn’t been well received by students, being environmentally conscious is still important, and recycling and using plastic responsibly is a significant aspect of that consciousness. </p>

        <p> “[The New School tries] to come off as sustainable, but the amount of plastic that people use is crazy. Nothing is done about it,”  said Alicia Abramson, another Parsons First-Year student, “I really care about the environment. I even carry around my own utensils so I don't have to use plastic forks and spoons.” </a></p>

     <p>Along with focusing on paper and plastic recycling, The University Center and at the 16th Street building are the two buildings on campus that have receptacles for compost along with the three aforementioned bins.  </p>
     <br> <br>
     <P>“We pay quite a bit for composting,” said Eibert, who claims that the school goes “above and beyond” to make sure that the cafeteria food waste is composted.</P>
     <br> <br>
     <p>Along with food waste generated by students, in the cafeteria all containers and utensils are made with compostable materials.</p>
     <br> <br>
     <p>“I had no idea that everything was compostable,” said Madison Frazee, a Parsons student, “you can even compost the sushi containers.”</p>
     <br> <br>
     <p>In order to align with the University’s goals of sustainability, the use of the compostable containers was implemented in the kitchen, which is operated by Chartwells, a food service.</p>
     <br> <br>
     <p>“Chartwells has been a good partner and has been willing to help with change,” said Gregory Herrera, Assistant Director of Business Operations of the cafeteria. </p>

     <p>The cafeteria has been an area of contention between students, workers and administration recently due to the firing of all cafeteria workers and the severing of business with Chartwells, with a goal of bringing the cafeteria in-house. </p>

     <p>In fact, the amount of plastic in US landfills peaked at over 25 million tons in 2014, according to the EPA. That amount of plastic is the weight of 125,000 blue whales, or the approximate combined weight of the entire population of the United States. </p>

     <p>I'm not asking that you go dumpster diving, but holding an empty plastic cup for a little bit instead of throwing it away where it will exist for all time seems easy, at least to me. </p>
